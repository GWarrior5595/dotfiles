## Installation
Run the makefile via `$ make` in the root directory. Instructions will then be displayed on the screen. If run on Windows, you will need to run it on the Windows Subsystem for Linux. There are also some scripts in the bin folder that can be run individually to install something. 

## Dependencies
Most package managers will install necessary dependencies as necessary. Usually I will also add the optional software to enable extra features. I've tried to add requirements for anything if I use it to individual readmes per software folder. However, the core requirements are as follows:

- bash
- git 
- gpg
- ncurses 
- ssh
- vim

An assumption is made that Arch Linux with AUR support is enabled. Note packages are NOT currently installed automatically when runnning the make file.

## Note/Disclaimer
As always, blindly copying/installing any piece of software may result in a non-working configuration. I give 0 guarantee that things will work. In fact, there is a very high probability that it will NOT work out of the box for you. Please take the time to read through the documentation I have provided.
