Dotfiles for my own personal use. Currently not in a state for someone other than me to fork/clone and use. However, feel free to look through things like my ```.vimrc``` and see how I've set it up.

##Note/Disclaimer
As always, blindly copying/installing dot files may or may not result in a working configuration. I give 0 guarantee that things will work. In fact, there is a very high probability that it will NOT work out of the box for you.

I assume that if you're using any of my files you've read my comments I've added through out.

## TODO
Currently there is a lot of things to do.

- Setup installer using [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot).
- Depdency stuff.
- SSH stuff with link to dropbox or w/e I choose to keep it.

## Depdencies** (TODO)*
- Make dependecy list. 
- Reduce number of dependecies (Vim, etc)
- Create a install file that will acquire dependecies.
    - Should have options for Windows, Ubuntu (apt-get), and Arch (pacman).
    - Customize with prompts? Maybe multiple install files for different ocassions.
