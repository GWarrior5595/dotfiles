Dotfiles for my own personal use. Currently not in a state for someone other than me to fork/clone and use. However, feel free to look through things like my ```.vimrc``` and see how I've set it up.

##Note/Disclaimer
As always, blindly copying/installing dot files may or may not result in a working configuration. I give 0 guarantee that things will work. In fact, there is a very high probability that it will NOT work out of the box for you.

I assume that if you're using any of my files you've read my comments I've added through out.

## TODO
Currently there is a lot of things to do. So far, I am in the process of revamping my dotfiles.

* Put common stuff for bash and zsh into a single file (such as exporting something).
* Build proper prompts for bash/zsh.
* Slim down vim config and remove excess plugins. 
* Create proper make file.
* Create a bin directory of useful scripts.
* Clean up gitconfig of unused aliases. 
* Set up ranger, i3, and various other config files.
