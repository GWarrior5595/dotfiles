Currently not in a state for someone other than me to fork/clone and use. However, feel free to look through things like my ```.vimrc``` and see how I've set it up.\r\n\r\n##Note/Disclaimer\r\nAs always, blindly copying/installing dot files may or may not result in a working configuration. I give 0 guarantee that things will work. In fact, there is a very high probability that it will NOT work out of the box for you.\r\n\r\nI assume that if you're using any of my files you've read my comments I've added through out.\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\nCurrently there is a lot of things to do.\r\n\r\n- Setup installer using [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot).\r\n- Depdency stuff.\r\n- SSH stuff with link to dropbox or w/e I choose to keep it.\r\n\r\n## Depdencies** (TODO)*\r\n- Make dependecy list. \r\n- Reduce number of dependecies (Vim, etc)\r\n- Create a install file that will acquire dependecies.\r\n    - Should have options for Windows, Ubuntu (apt-get), and Arch (pacman).\r\n    - Customize with prompts? Maybe multiple install files for different ocassions.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
